# Project-Mask-face-detection-with-trained-checkpoint
This project develops a CNN-based mask detection system to classify images as "with mask" or "without mask." It includes data preprocessing, model training, performance visualization, and prediction functionality. Achieving ~90% accuracy, the model can be deployed to detect mask usage in images or real-time applications.
